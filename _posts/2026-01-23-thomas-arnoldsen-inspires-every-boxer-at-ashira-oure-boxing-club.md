Here, boxers like Thomas Arnoldsen are not just training—they’re inspiring everyone around them, showing how commitment and community drive real growth.

## A Boxing Journey That Motivates

Thomas Arnoldsen is a shining example of what’s possible at Ashira Oure Boxing Club. Whether it’s your first boxing class or you’re preparing for competition, his story highlights what makes AOBC unique. Under the guidance of Evans Ashira—a former world champion—members discover more than just fitness boxing. They find a place where discipline, respect, and teamwork come first.

At AOBC, every boxer’s journey matters. Thomas began as a beginner and quickly embraced the club’s ethos: determination, hard work, and constant improvement. His progress speaks to the supportive environment that welcomes all levels, from newcomers to seasoned fighters.
