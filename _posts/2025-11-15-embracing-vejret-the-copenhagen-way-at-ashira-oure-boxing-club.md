In Copenhagen, vejret—the weather—shapes our days, our routines, and our mindset. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC), founded by world champion Evans Ashira, we harness the spirit of Copenhagen’s ever-changing climate to inspire strength, resilience, and community in every training session. Whether the skies are bright or the rain is falling, our doors in Hellerup and Charlottenlund are always open, welcoming everyone from complete beginners to seasoned fighters.

### Why Vejret Inspires Our Boxing Community in Copenhagen

There’s something powerful about training in sync with the shifting Danish seasons. As the city adapts to cold winds, sudden showers, or sunny bursts, so do our members. Vejret is more than a backdrop—it’s a reminder that persistence, flexibility, and positivity can turn any day into a winning one. At AOBC, we believe the weather outside is never an obstacle but an invitation to conquer new challenges together in our Copenhagen boxing club.
