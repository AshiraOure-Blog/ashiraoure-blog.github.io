Copenhagen’s weather can be famously unpredictable—one moment the sun is shining, the next, a sudden downpour soaks the city streets. But wetter days don’t have to sideline your training or dampen your motivation. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC), founded by world champion Evans Ashira, we believe rain is just another reason to step inside and ignite your passion for boxing.

## Embrace the Wetter Weather and Level Up Your Training in Copenhagen

When the skies open up in Copenhagen, AOBC’s doors are always open wider. We know that staying active during Denmark’s wetter seasons is a challenge, but our Copenhagen boxing club community thrives on turning obstacles into opportunities. AOBC welcomes everyone—from absolute beginners searching for their first boxing club for beginners, to seasoned fighters seeking the best boxing gym in Copenhagen for competition prep and sparring classes.

### Why Wetter Days Are Perfect for Boxing at AOBC in Hellerup and Charlottenlund
