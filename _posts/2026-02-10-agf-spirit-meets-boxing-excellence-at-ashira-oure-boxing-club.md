At Ashira Oure Boxing Club, the energy of Copenhagen thrives with the same passion and community spirit that AGF fans know and love. Just as AGF inspires the city through football, AOBC brings together people of all backgrounds and skill levels to pursue fitness, discipline, and personal growth through boxing. Whether you’re a newcomer looking for your first boxing class or an experienced athlete aiming for competition, Ashira Oure Boxing Club is your home for boxing excellence.

### Why AOBC Stands Out in Copenhagen

Founded by former world champion Evans Ashira, AOBC isn’t just another boxing gym in Copenhagen—it’s a community where every member is empowered to challenge themselves. With locations in Hellerup and Charlottenlund, our doors are open to everyone, from beginners to competitive boxers.

**What sets us apart?**
- **Expert Coaching:** Train under Evans Ashira and a dedicated team who bring world-class experience to every session.
- **Classes for All Levels:** From beginner boxing classes to advanced sparring and competition training, there’s a place for everyone.
- **Inclusive Atmosphere:** AOBC thrives on creating a supportive environment where every member feels valued, motivated, and inspired.

### The AOBC Experience: Discipline, Fitness, and Growth

At AOBC, we believe that boxing is about more than just physical fitness—it’s about cultivating discipline and building confidence. Our programs are designed to help you achieve your goals, whether you’re looking for boxing fitness, personal coaching, or youth boxing opportunities for your children.

**Our most popular offerings include:**
- **Boxing classes for all ages:** From kids boxing near me to youth boxing programs, we nurture young talent and encourage healthy habits.
- **Sparring classes and competition prep:** Step into the ring with confidence, guided by our expert trainers and safe, structured sparring sessions.
- **Fitness-focused workouts:** Experience the power of boxing and fitness classes for building strength, agility, and endurance.
- **Personal coaching:** Achieve your unique goals with one-on-one training tailored to your needs.

### AOBC and the Copenhagen Community

We welcome everyone—from complete beginners to seasoned boxers, from fitness enthusiasts to those aiming to compete at the highest level. Our members are diverse, but we’re united by a shared drive to improve and support one another.
