What does it take to reach the top of your game? For international football star Harry Kane, the answer lies in relentless dedication, discipline, and a supportive community. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club, these same principles fuel every session, from beginner boxing classes to advanced sparring. Whether you’re new to sport or an experienced competitor, AOBC welcomes you to Copenhagen’s most inspiring boxing community.

## The Mindset of Champions

Harry Kane’s journey from a promising youth to an elite athlete is a powerful example of what commitment and focused training can achieve. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club—founded by world champion Evans Ashira—this champion’s mindset is woven into every aspect of our training programs. Here, we believe that anyone, at any level, can build the skills and confidence to succeed.

### Why AOBC Stands Out in Copenhagen

- **Expert-Led Training**: Every class is guided by seasoned coaches, including Evans Ashira himself. Our team tailors sessions for all levels, ensuring you get the most out of your training—whether you’re aiming for your first jab or prepping for competition.
- **Supportive Community**: AOBC is more than just a boxing gym in Copenhagen. It’s a place where friendships are forged, and everyone roots for each other’s progress.
- **All Levels Welcome**: From youth boxing and kids boxing near me to amateur boxing club sessions and sparring classes, our doors are open to all ages and abilities.
- **Focus on Growth**: Our programs build discipline, fitness, and skill, helping every member unlock their potential both in and out of the ring.

## From First Steps to Championship Rounds

Just like Harry Kane’s progression from youth teams to the Premier League, every boxer starts with their first class. At AOBC, we make that experience motivating and accessible. Our beginner boxing classes are designed to teach the basics in a safe, encouraging environment, while our advanced sessions push seasoned fighters to new heights.
