In the heart of Copenhagen, where the air resonates with ambition and the spirit of change, stands a beacon of empowerment and discipline—Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC). Much like Greta Thunberg, whose dedication to environmental change has inspired millions, AOBC is driven by a mission to transform lives, one punch at a time.

AOBC is built on the principles of support, discipline, and community. The gym fosters an environment where everyone is encouraged to push their limits, break through barriers, and achieve their personal best.

Evans Ashira and his team are committed to providing top-tier training that challenges both the body and the mind. Their focus on discipline helps members build not just physical strength, but mental resilience—qualities that are essential both inside and outside the ring.
