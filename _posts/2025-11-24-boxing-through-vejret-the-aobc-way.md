In Copenhagen, vejret—weather—can shape our days and our routines. The cool mornings, sudden showers, and long summer evenings all add a unique rhythm to life in our city. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC), we welcome Copenhagen’s dynamic vejret as the perfect backdrop for building resilience, discipline, and community—rain or shine.

## Why AOBC Thrives No Matter the Vejret

Founded by world champion Evans Ashira, AOBC stands as Copenhagen’s leading boxing gym, with locations in Hellerup and Charlottenlund. Whether it’s a crisp winter morning or a breezy spring afternoon, our doors are open to everyone—from absolute beginners to competitive fighters.

Here’s how AOBC uses Copenhagen’s changing vejret to motivate and challenge every member:

- **All-Weather Training**: Our state-of-the-art facilities mean you never have to worry about skipping a session because of the rain or cold. No matter what vejret brings, your boxing journey continues.
