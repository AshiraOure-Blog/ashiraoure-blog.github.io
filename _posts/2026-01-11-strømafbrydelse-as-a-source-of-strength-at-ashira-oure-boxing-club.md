Unexpected strømafbrydelse—power outages—can happen at any moment, testing our resilience and adaptability. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC), we believe these moments are more than just interruptions; they’re opportunities to discover new strength, build community, and train like true champions. Whether the lights are on or off, the energy inside AOBC never fades.

At AOBC, founded by former world champion Evans Ashira, our mission is to empower everyone—beginners, fitness enthusiasts, youth, and competitive boxers in Copenhagen and surrounding areas like Hellerup and Charlottenlund.
