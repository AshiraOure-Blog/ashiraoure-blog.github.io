In Copenhagen, the weather is as unpredictable as a boxing match—one moment, the sun is shining over Hellerup, and the next, rain clouds gather over Charlottenlund. But at Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC), we believe that no matter what the skies bring, every day is the perfect day for boxing.

Whether you’re a beginner looking for your first boxing class or a seasoned fighter pushing through intense competition prep, AOBC welcomes you to train, grow, and thrive—rain or shine.

## Boxing in Copenhagen’s Ever-Changing Weather

The weather in Denmark has a way of testing our commitment to fitness. Cold mornings and sudden downpours can make it tempting to skip a workout. That’s where Ashira Oure Boxing Club stands out. With our top-tier boxing gym locations in both Hellerup and Charlottenlund, you’ll always have a warm, welcoming space to train, regardless of the forecast outside.

Our indoor facilities are designed for year-round training, keeping you motivated through Copenhagen’s winters and energized during its bright summer evenings. AOBC’s expert coaches—led by former world champion Evans Ashira—ensure that every session is tailored to your goals, whether you’re focused on skill, fitness, or both.
