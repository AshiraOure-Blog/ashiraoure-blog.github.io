When the skies over Copenhagen shift from bright and sunny to cool and rainy, the spirit inside Ashira Oure Boxing Club (AOBC) only grows stronger. At AOBC, founded by legendary world champion Evans Ashira, we embrace vejret—weather—and use it as fuel to push ourselves further, both in and out of the ring.

#### Turning Copenhagen’s Weather Into Your Advantage

Whether you’re a beginner looking for your first boxing class or an experienced fighter preparing for competition, the Copenhagen climate offers an extra edge. At Ashira Oure Boxing Club, located in Hellerup and Charlottenlund, we know that real champions are built not only through skill and discipline but also by adapting to every challenge—including the city’s ever-changing weather.
